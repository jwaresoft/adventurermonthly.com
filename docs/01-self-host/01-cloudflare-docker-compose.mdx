# Foundry SelfHost With Cloudflare & Docker Compose

<img src="/img/guides-img/flying-whales.webp" className="guide-img-600" />

An alternative to port forwarding utilizing cloudflare tunnels and a docker installation on a local machine.

<SelfHostDisclaimer />

## 1. Setup a Cloudflare Account

If you don't already have one, [sign up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) for one.

## 2. Purchase or Transfer a Domain Name

This is the domain (or a subdomain of this domain) where your instance will be available online.  You only need one domain if you plan to run multiple foundry instances as you will be able to assign subdomains when setting up tunnel(s) in a later step.  

### 2.a If You Already Purchased A Domain Elsewhere...

There are a few steps to setup your domain with cloudflare if you purchased it elsewhere.

Before you can set up your tunnel, you will need to [add a site and configure cloudflare domain servers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/).

These are the prereqs you will see in the [tunnel docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/local/#prerequisites).

### 2.b If You Would Like To Just Buy One At Cloudflare

You can register a new domain name with [Cloudflare Registrar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/get-started/register-domain/).

You will want to [add a site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/account-setup/add-site/) in either case as I believe it is a required step for the tunnel.  I cannot confirm if registering a domain through Cloudflare sets up a site or not as I already had a domain and thus did 2.a.


## 3. Setup a new Tunnel

This can be done either through **Cloudflare's WebUI** or for those prefering the command line, the **Cloudflare CLI**.  Up to date instructions for both can be found in [Cloudflare's create your first tunnel docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/).

If you are uncomfortable with the command line I would recommend [Setting up a tunnel through the web dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/create-remote-tunnel/) as it is point and click.  I have provided a few notes below to help clarify the cloudflare instructions for those new to all of this.

- you can hold off on steps **1.5** and **1.6**  until after you have everything set up.
- you *will* ideally want to keep your tunnel token from these steps, and keep it somewhere **SAFE** like a password manager.  If you do not, you can always log in and access it later by editing the existing tunnel.
- for the hostname of this (and any tunnel you set up for use with the docker compose setup below) you can use `foundry:30000`.  This is explained more in the Docker Compose steps.


## 4. Docker Compose

You will want to install docker, and docker compose (now comes bundled with docker) in order to run foundry with the cloudflare daemon.  If you are new to docker and docker compose, there are some (hopefully) helpful links and snippets in [the Docker General Info / Links section](/docs/general/docker).

### 4.1 Install Docker & Docker Compose

Install docker for your desktop environment using the steps below.

<InstallDockerTabs />

### 4.2 Clone / Download the Docker Config.

The [foundry-cloudflared repo](https://github.com/jwaresoft/foundry-cloudflared) contains `the docker-compose.yml` necessary to run this.  You can either clone it or if you are unfamiliar with git, download the repo as a zip by clicking the **Code** dropdown button.

### 4.3 Populate Settings Files.

you will not need to change the docker-compose.yml file itself, unless you want to override the default volume.  You WILL need to create a directory and 3 files.

#### .env

Create a file called `.env` in the directory with the `docker-compose.yml` file.  Use your favorite / any text editor to add the following to it:

```
VERSION=
```

where the value is the version number you would like to pin to.  For example, for version 11.307, you would create

EXAMPLE
```
VERSION=11.307
```

This will keep the docker container at the version specified.  To update in the future, you simply need to stop the docker compose setup, update this file, and start it again.  It will update on boot.

#### ./env.d/foundry

Our next two files need to be put in a directory called `env.d` so you will want to create that at the project root now.  Then create a file in the `env.d` directory called `foundry` and populate it with the following:

```
FOUNDRY_PASSWORD=           
FOUNDRY_USERNAME=
FOUNDRY_ADMIN_KEY=
CONTAINER_PRESERVE_CONFIG=true
```
where

- FOUNDRY_PASSWORD - your password for https://foundryvtt.com/.
- FOUNDRY_USERNAME - your username for https://foundryvtt.com
- FOUNDRY_ADMIN_KEY - set your admin password here for the server.  You can reset it here in the furture as well.

#### ./env.d/cloudflared

Last create another file in `env.d` called `cloudflared` and add the following:

```
TUNNEL_TOKEN=
```

where

- TUNNEL_TOKEN - the token for your cloudflare tunnel.  If you didn't save it somewhere safe earlier you can get it by logging into cloudflare and clicking edit for the tunnel.  You don't need to edit anything, just grab the token value from the code snippet.

### 4.4 (Optional) Copy Foundry Data

If you are just going to start fresh you can skip this step.  If you have a bunch of foudry data locally which you would like to copy over, you can do the following:

- create a folder `foundry-data` at the root of the project.  If you skipped this step and ran the setup, you will already have this directory.
- Copy your `Data` and/or `Config` directories from your local foundry directory into `foundry-data`.  You should be good to go.
- If you would like to backup your server, you can just create a copy of the `foundry-data` directory at any time and keep it somewhere safe.

### 4.5 Run it.

To run it, from the root of the directory run 

```
docker compose up
```

in the command line.  I am not sure how to run this from docker desktop directory as I set it up using docker-engine on linux.  I believe you will need to have docker desktop running to have this running.  Google instructions for this and reach out and let us know how it went!

to shutdown the servers, run 

```
docker compose down
```

## Troubleshooting


### Permission Denied Running `docker compose up'

This is expected as by default only root can run docker commands.  This note should get you around it.
